# Decline Curve Analysis using Python

## Project Introduction:
Welcome to the README for the Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) project conducted at PDEU from January to May 2023. This project focused on developing a Python-based DCA model for optimizing oil production, emphasizing production forecast.

## Project Overview:
Forecasting Model: Managed a six-member team to develop a predictive model utilizing ensemble machine learning techniques, including regression and stacking, for enhanced accuracy in production forecasting.
Web Scraping: Implemented web scraping for real-time crude prices, resulting in a 15% increase in update speed and potential annual cost savings of $2M.
Algorithmic Analysis: Applied ensemble machine learning techniques to analyze historical production data and optimize oil production strategies.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Designed and implemented a user-friendly GUI to facilitate seamless interaction with the DCA model.

## Key Achievements:
1. Demonstrated effective leadership and collaboration within a multidisciplinary team.
2. Leveraged Python for intricate data analysis and model implementation.
3. Optimized data acquisition processes, ensuring real-time and cost-efficient updates for pivotal inputs.

## Libraries Used:
The project extensively utilized Python libraries, including but not limited to:

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib
5. BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
6. Tkinter (for GUI development)

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the main script.
