# Decline Curve Analysis using Python
## Project Introduction:
Welcome to the README for the Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) major project conducted at PDEU from January to May 2023. This project, led by a team of six members, focused on developing a Python-based DCA model for economic production rate forecasting.

## Project Overview:
1. Forecasting Model: Created a sophisticated forecasting model utilizing advanced stacking techniques for enhanced accuracy.
2. Web Scraping: Implemented web scraping for real-time crude prices, resulting in a 15% increase in update speed and annual cost savings of $2M.
3. Algorithmic Analysis: Applied linear regression and random forest algorithms for a comprehensive decline curve analysis.
4. Graphical User Interface (GUI): Designed and implemented a user-friendly GUI to facilitate seamless interaction with the DCA model.

## Key Achievements:
1. Demonstrated effective leadership and collaboration within a multidisciplinary team.
2. Leveraged Python for intricate data analysis and model implementation.
3. Optimized data acquisition processes, ensuring real-time and cost-efficient updates for pivotal inputs.

## Libraries Used:
The project extensively utilized Python libraries, including but not limited to:

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib
5. BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
6. Tkinter (for GUI development)

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the main script.

Feel free to explore the project, contribute, and adapt it for your needs. We welcome feedback and collaboration!
